This repository contains everything you need to make your own real-life, hard copies of every volume of _[Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality](http://hpmor.com/)_, with [Lulu](http://www.lulu.com/)! 

Eliezer Yudkowsky, or anyone else, isn't allowed to sell the book, because it's based on J. K. Rowling's copyrighted universe of characters. But, you _can_ create your own private copy of the book with Lulu, a service that prints books on demand, and then order yourself a proof copy. That way, you can experience it on paper!

Want an ebook? Then you don't need this repository! Because that's [already officially supported](http://hpmor.com/).

## Praise

> "Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality poses an alternate world in which Harry is a genius. ... It's a terrific series, subtle and dramatic and stimulating. Yudkowsky gets it, and lots else. Smart guy, good writer. Poses hugely terrific questions that I, too, had thought of... and a number that I hadn't. Enjoyed all references to the Enlightenment. I wish all Potter fans would go here, and try on a bigger, bolder and more challenging tale."
> —[David Brin](http://davidbrin.blogspot.com/2010/06/secret-of-college-life-plus.html)

> "Oh Thoth Trismegistus, oh Ma'at, oh Ganesha, oh sweet lady Eris... I have not laughed so hard in years! ... Read it and laugh. Read it and learn. Eliezer re-invents Harry Potter as a skeptic genius who sets himself the task of figuring out just how all this "magic" stuff works. Strongly recommended. And if you manage to learn about sources of cognitive bias like the Planning Fallacy and the Bystander Effect, among others, while your sides are hurting with laughter, so much the better."
> —[Eric S. Raymond](http://esr.ibiblio.org/?p=2100)

> "Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality is the sort of thing that would technically be called a fanfic, but is more appropriately named a work of sheer genius. It takes the basic Harry Potter story and asks, "what if, instead of a boy locked in a closet, he was a child genius raised by a loving pair of adoptive parents who brought science, reason, and modern thinking to the wizarding world?" ... LOVE. IT. Read it, seriously. It will change your way of looking at the world."
> —[Rachel Aaron](http://civilian-reader.blogspot.com/2011/05/interview-with-rachel-aaron.html)

> "This is a book whose title still makes me laugh and yet it may just turn out to be one of the greatest books ever written. The writing is shockingly good, the plotting is some of the best in all of literature, and the stories are simply pure genius. I fear this book may never get the accoldaes it deserves, because it's too hard to look past the silly name and publishing model, but I hope you, dear reader, are wiser than that! A must-read."
> —[Aaron Swartz](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/books2011)

## Instructions

To get your own hard copies of each of the Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality volumes, I'll walk you through how to print them with Lulu. We're going to use Lulu's "private" feature, so that the books are only visible to you, so that you aren't violating any copyright laws by "profiting" off of the works. (Don't worry, it's easy!)

![](images/0.png)

To start, download a copy of this repository as a **ZIP** file, and extract it somewhere on your computer.

![](images/1.png)

You should end up with a folder that contains subfolders with the resources needed to create each volume. We'll use these files during the Lulu book creation process.

If you don't have one already, you'll need to create your own Lulu account.

![](images/2.png)

Then, on the homepage, click **Create**.

![](images/3.png)

And then, click to **Start a print book**.

![](images/4.png)

Select the **6" x 9"** book, of either **Standard** or **Premium** quality, and then click **Make this book**. I chose Premium paper, but Standard should work just fine as well, and be slightly cheaper.

![](images/5.png)

Then enter the title and author information you want, which is only useful for keeping track yourself, since no one else will ever see it. Make sure to select **Make available only to me** so that you aren't violating copyright! That's critical.

![](images/6.png)

Next you need to hit **Choose File**...

![](images/7.png)

... and **Open** the `contents.pdf` from the `1 - Harry Potter and the Methods of Reality` folder, which contains all of the innards of the first volume of the series.

![](images/8.png)

Then hit **Upload**...

![](images/9.png)

...wait for the upload to complete...

![](images/10.png)

...and once it has, click **Make Print-Ready File**.

![](images/11.png)

Lulu will need to process the file before we can continue, so it can calculate things like the spine's width based on the number of pages. (All of the cover images are already designed to take the spine widths of each book into mind!)

![](images/12.png)

Once that is done, hit **Save & Continue**.

![](images/13.png)

The "normal" cover designer will start to load, but you want to use the **advanced one-piece cover designer** instead, which lets us you upload a single image file for the entire cover, meaning that we can design the spine as well. So click that...

![](images/14.png)

...and then **Choose File**...

![](images/15.png)

...and select the `cover.png` from the same `1 - Harry Potter and the Methods of Reality` folder, and hit **Open**.

![](images/16.png)

Then hit **Upload**...

![](images/17.png)

...and wait for the upload to complete.

![](images/18.png)

Once it has, you should see the cover image. Hit **Save & Continue**...

![](images/19.png)

...and **Save & Continue** again...

![](images/20.png)

...and then **Save & Finish**...

![](images/21.png)

...and the book is complete! Now you can click that long URL to see it.

![](images/22.png)

There it is. Now all you need to do is **Add to Cart**... 

![](images/23.png)

...and there you have it! You can either continue making a book for each other volume in the series and add them to your cart too, or, if you haven't read the series yet, you can just order the first volume and see if you like it first!

Have fun!
