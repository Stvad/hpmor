Want an ebook? Then you don't need this repository! Because that's [already officially supported](http://hpmor.com/).

## Praise

> "Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality poses an alternate world in which Harry is a genius. ... It's a terrific series, subtle and dramatic and stimulating. Yudkowsky gets it, and lots else. Smart guy, good writer. Poses hugely terrific questions that I, too, had thought of... and a number that I hadn't. Enjoyed all references to the Enlightenment. I wish all Potter fans would go here, and try on a bigger, bolder and more challenging tale."
> —[David Brin](http://davidbrin.blogspot.com/2010/06/secret-of-college-life-plus.html)

> "Oh Thoth Trismegistus, oh Ma'at, oh Ganesha, oh sweet lady Eris... I have not laughed so hard in years! ... Read it and laugh. Read it and learn. Eliezer re-invents Harry Potter as a skeptic genius who sets himself the task of figuring out just how all this "magic" stuff works. Strongly recommended. And if you manage to learn about sources of cognitive bias like the Planning Fallacy and the Bystander Effect, among others, while your sides are hurting with laughter, so much the better."
> —[Eric S. Raymond](http://esr.ibiblio.org/?p=2100)

> "Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality is the sort of thing that would technically be called a fanfic, but is more appropriately named a work of sheer genius. It takes the basic Harry Potter story and asks, "what if, instead of a boy locked in a closet, he was a child genius raised by a loving pair of adoptive parents who brought science, reason, and modern thinking to the wizarding world?" ... LOVE. IT. Read it, seriously. It will change your way of looking at the world."
> —[Rachel Aaron](http://civilian-reader.blogspot.com/2011/05/interview-with-rachel-aaron.html)

> "This is a book whose title still makes me laugh and yet it may just turn out to be one of the greatest books ever written. The writing is shockingly good, the plotting is some of the best in all of literature, and the stories are simply pure genius. I fear this book may never get the accoldaes it deserves, because it's too hard to look past the silly name and publishing model, but I hope you, dear reader, are wiser than that! A must-read."

Behind them the doors of Hogwarts quickly receded, and the dark grounds moved closer. The track they now walked was muddy and indistinct. The trees, branches formerly bare with winter, were not fully clad with spring; their...
